<H2> Errata for the preface </H2>

<UL>
    <LI> Thanks go to Maggie Hampton for pointing out the "a a" in the
         first sentence of the preface. </LI>
    <LI> Tim Hampton pointed out that I had Southern's zip starting with
         4 instead of 3.  But at least it was not a spelling error!</LI>
    <LI> Tim also noticed on page iii that I started a sentence with
         "These is".  Once again my spelling skills are great ;-)</LI>
    <LI> On page iii the third paragraph should end with a period. </LI>
    <LI> On page iii I invented the word "domimant". </LI>
    <LI> On page iv, third paragraph, I used "languages" where I should
         have used "language".</LI>
